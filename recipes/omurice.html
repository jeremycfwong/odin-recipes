    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <ul>
        <h4>For the Ketchup Fried Rice</h4>    
            <li>½ onion</li>
            <li>1 boneless, skinless chicken thigh</li>
            <li>1 Tbsp extra virgin olive oil</li>
            <li>½ cup frozen mixed vegetables (defrosted)</li>
            <li>⅛ tsp kosher salt (Diamond Crystal; use half for table salt)</li>
            <li>⅛ tsp freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>2 servings cooked Japanese short-grain rice </li>
            <li>1 Tbsp ketchup (plus more for decoration)</li>
            <li>1 tsp soy sauce</li>

        <h4>For the Omelettes</h4>
            <li>2 large eggs (50 g w/o shell) (divided)</li>
            <li>2 Tbsp milk (divided)</li>
            <li>2 Tbsp extra virgin olive oil (divided)</li>
            <li>6 Tbsp shredded sharp cheddar cheese (or any other kind)</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all the ingredients. If you are using 1¾ cups of freshly cooked rice, 
            transfer the hot rice to a baking sheet. Spread it out and let it cool 
            completely.</li>
    
        <h4>To Make the Ketchup Fried Rice</h4>    
            <li>Mince the onion finely into ⅛-inch (3 mm) pieces.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Dice the chicken into ½-inch (1.3 cm) pieces.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Heat the oil in a large frying pan over medium heat and sauté the onions 
                until tender.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Add the chicken and cook until it's no longer pink.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Add the mixed vegetables and season with salt and pepper.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Add the cooled rice and use a cutting motion with your spatula to break the 
                clumps into small pieces.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Add the ketchup and soy sauce and stir to combine. Transfer the fried rice 
                to a plate and wash the pan.</li>

        <h4>To Make the Omurice</h4>
            <li>We'll make the omurice one at a time. Whisk 1 egg and 1 Tbsp milk in a small 
                bowl.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Heat 1 Tbsp oil in the pan over medium-high heat. Distribute the oil to make 
                sure the surface of the pan is coated well.</li>
            <br>
            <li>When the pan is hot, pour in the egg mixture and tilt the pan to coat the 
                entire surface with the egg. Cook the egg until the bottom has set but the 
                top is still soft. Lower the heat to medium low.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Sprinkle 3 Tbsp cheese on top, then add half of the ketchup fried rice across 
                the middle of the omelette.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Use the spatula to fold both sides of the omelette over the middle to cover 
                the fried rice. Carefully move the omurice to the edge of the pan.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Holding a plate in one hand and the pan in the other, flip the pan to transfer
                 the omurice, seam side down, onto the plate.</li>
            <br>
            <li>While it’s still hot, cover the omurice with a paper towel and form it with 
                your hands into an elongated oval shape (similar to an American football or 
                rugby ball). Repeat this process to make the next omurice.</li>
    </ol>
