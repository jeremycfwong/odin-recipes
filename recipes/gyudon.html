    <h2>More Details</h2>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>300 grams of Thinly Sliced Beef (Chadolbaegi or Shabu-Shabu Cut)</li>
        <li>1 whole onion</li>
        <li>½ cup of Anchovy-Kelp Broth (or use Katsuobushi Dashi Broth)</li>
        <li>1-2 stalks of green onion</li>
        <li>1 egg yolk</li>
        <li>1 bowl of Rice</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <h4>Make Broth</h4>
        
        <li>Make anchovy-kelp from scratch (see notes below). Or use an anchovy-kelp broth 
            packet to make the broth quickly. We'll only need ½ a cup so save the leftover 
            broth for another Korean soup or stew.</li>

        <h4>Prep Ingredients & Make Soy Sauce Marinade</h4>
        
        <li>Cut onion into thin slices. Then finely dice green onion stalk. Now take out a 
            mixing bowl and evenly mix: Soy Sauce (3 Tablespoons), Mirim (2 Tablespoons), 
            Sugar (1 Tablespoon) and Fresh Ginger (4-5 grates). </li>

        <h4>Make Gyudon</h4>
        
        <li>Put a frying pan on medium-high heat. Then add in a drizzle of oil. Add your beef 
            slices in. Once it starts to cook and turn grey on one-side, add in the sliced 
            onions. Stir everything around for 30 seconds.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Give your soy sauce mixture another stir and then pour into your frying pan. Then 
            add in the ½ cup of broth. </li>
        <br>
        <li>Allow the broth to cook and reduce for about 10 minutes (or until the onions turn 
            soft). You can reduce for longer if you want less broth. Turn off the heat. Use a 
            pair of tongs and grab that succulent meat. Spread it over a bowl of hot rice.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Garnish with green onion, raw egg yolk and few sprinkles of Shichimi. Grab a 
            spoonful of the broth and spread it over the bowl. Bon Appetit. </li>
    </ol>
